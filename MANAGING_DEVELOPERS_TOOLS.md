# Managing developers tools

## Introduction

Managing developers tools can be hard. Many of us had issues, when switching between projects for some reason build, lint, typecheck and other scripts don't work properly. The same situation can happen, when you work on the same project on different machines. On one machine build, lint, typecheck and others run a OK. And on another machine the same scripts fail with a strange issue. In many (if not in most) cases the reason of this issue is mismatching of develpers tools versions between different environments. For example, in one environment the Node version is 18.18.1 and in another environment it's 20.0.0. Or another example is when one environment uses yarn/pnpm/npm of one version and in another environment the version is different. For many years there were no stable solution for such type of issues. And now we have some of them.
