# PNPM
PNPM is a relatively new package manager, which is faster than any another because of some special dependencies mechanism resolution.

We use `pnpm` for both, non-monorepo and monorepo projects.

## Usage for the non-monorepo

The usage for the non-monorepo is very simple. You just should use `pnpm` command instead of `yarn/npm` or whatever you've used previously.
