1. Add "validate" script to be used in the "validate" job of the github actions workflow (not for this package but for all other packages, created with this package).
2. Add "precommit" script to be run on "precommit".
3. Add .lintstaged config.
4. Add release job for the github actions workflow.
5. Add lint step for the "validate" job of the current package.

1. Add typecheck script. We can't use for typechecking build script since it emits tests files to the output directory.
So, we need to create an editional script just for typechecking. It should use base typescript config.

2. Add --no-clean option for the build script. It will cancel removal of the dist folder when build script is running. By default
build script should always remove the dist folder before emitting the next compilation output.

3. Describe the presence of the two typescript configuration files in the project. The base config is used for 
linting and typechecking purposes and the build config is used for building purposes.

4. exclude option in the typescript configs should exclude only files which are included by the include option. It means it
doesn't make sense exclude something, which was not previously included by the "include" option.

5. It's not possible to run jupiter-scripts scripts for this project since:
  - we are preparing the ts configs while we are running scripts;
  - we are using the code in the /dist folder to run the scripts. 

  Need to explain it in the docs.

6. Describe why for the current project the custom "build" script is used instead of the one from the package. 
Also describe how the "scripts" section of this packages looks like and why it looks like that.
